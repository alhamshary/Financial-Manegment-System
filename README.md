# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for Firebase App Hosting.

To deploy your application, simply commit your changes to your Git repository. Firebase App Hosting is connected to your repository and will automatically trigger a new build and deployment upon each new commit to the main branch.

The build process runs the `npm run build` command, which creates an optimized production build of your Next.js application. You do not need to run this command manually.
